## Project Overview
CoutureAI is an AI-powered clothing visualization tool designed to enhance the online shopping experience by allowing users to visualize their custom clothing designs. The project leverages **Stable Diffusion**, **Streamlit UI**, and **FastAPI backend** to generate high-quality clothing images from text descriptions. This helps consumers, fashion designers, and retailers bridge the gap between imagination and reality in fashion design.

### Key Features
- **AI-Driven Clothing Visualization**: Uses Stable Diffusion to generate realistic clothing images.
- **Custom Design Generation**: Users can input detailed clothing descriptions.
- **Interactive Refinement**: Provides AI-powered suggestions for modifications.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Built using Streamlit for seamless interaction.
- **E-Commerce Integration**: Potential for collaboration with retailers and fashion designers.
- **Inpainting & Masking**: Enhances image generation with AI-powered refinement.

### Target Users
- **Online Shoppers** who seek custom clothing options.
- **Fashion Designers** looking to visualize their designs.
- **Retailers & E-Commerce Platforms** aiming for AI-powered product customization.
- **Tailors & Custom Apparel Businesses** enhancing customer collaboration.

## Setup & Installation
### ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Check CUDA Availability & Clear Cache
```python
import torch

print("CUDA Available:", torch.cuda.is_available())

# Clear CUDA cache to free up memory
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

### ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Install Required Packages (Run Once)
```python
!pip install -q streamlit diffusers transformers accelerate torch nest_asyncio
!pip install -q nest_asyncio
```

### ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Import Required Libraries
```python
import torch
import streamlit as st
```


## Usage
- **Google Colab (Gen_Ai.ipynb)**: Run this for AI-based masking and inpainting.
- **Google Colab (main.ipynb)**: Load the pretrained model for direct inference.
- **VS Code (app.py)**: Start the UI and API for local execution.

## Challenges & Optimizations
- **Image Generation Performance**: Optimized Stable Diffusion for faster results.
- **Masking & Inpainting Accuracy**: Improved AI-generated designs with refined models.
